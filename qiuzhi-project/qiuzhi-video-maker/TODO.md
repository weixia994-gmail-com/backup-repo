# Video Generation Requirements

To create actual video files from our scripts, we need to implement:

1. Text-to-Speech (TTS) for narration
2. Background music integration
3. Visual elements (images, text overlays)
4. Video editing capabilities

For now, we have successfully generated all the content scripts and metadata that would be used in the actual videos.
