Today we completed the full video production pipeline for the qiuzhi-video-maker module:

1. Fixed the duplicate numbering issue in video scripts that was causing repetition in audio
2. Enhanced the audio generation to ensure complete sentences and proper flow
3. Implemented the complete video workflow including:
   - Text-to-speech functionality for narration
   - Video editing software framework
   - Background music generation algorithms
   - Visual element design and rendering
